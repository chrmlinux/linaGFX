Draw a line segment and one number on the memory
# v0.0.1
Test version released
# v0.1.0
-It is now possible to pass a drawing function to the drawing method, and I think that this work will enable display on an oscilloscope or another device.
-Corrected clipping processing for drawing processing, which completes support only in the drawing area.
